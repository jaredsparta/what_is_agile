**What are the four values of Agile?**
1. **Individuals and interactions over processes and tools**
    - It is the people who respond to business decisions; if the process or tools are the driver for development then the team is less responsive to change and less likely to satisfy customer needs.

2. **Working software over comprehensive documentation**
    - Agile documents requirements using user stores etc. which are sufficient for developers to build working iterations. This doesn't mean it disregards documentation altogether though, it does value it but it just values working software more.

3. **Customer collaboration over contract negotiation**
    - Allow the customer to be involved in the development process. This is juxtaposed with the waterfall model where customer needs were only really dealt with before and after the development process. This gives more transparency and allows the developers to really meet the customer's needs.

4. **Responding to change over following a plan**
    - Traditional software development meant following a detailed plan over a defined set of features. Agile allows one to do this while simultaneously allowing developers to adapt to changes and revelations in the product.
